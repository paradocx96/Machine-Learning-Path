   - DBSCAN
   - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)

2. Anomaly detection and novelty detection
   - One-class SVM
   - Isolation Forest

3. Visualization and dimensionality reduction
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Kernel PCA
   - Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
   - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

4. Association rule learning
   - Apriori
